## About

> I work in the aviation industry, my speciality is workforce managment. I am into programming and data analysis, therefore i excel in javascript, node.js, databases and python.

I love to put goals and try my best to acheive them and build on those achievments. As my grandfather in-law said You cannot one jump through the top of the mountain, one step at a time and always calculate your fall whereabouts. For every problem there is a solution.
